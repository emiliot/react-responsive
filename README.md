# Mahisoft mentorship project

## Goal

The main goal of this workshop is to create a base project for modern web applications, and learn cool and cutting edge technologies in the process.

## Technologies

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) as a dependency manager
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as a module bundler
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as the web library
* [Javascript ES6](http://es6-features.org/) as the programming language
* [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) React-Router v4 for routing
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) Scss for styling components. (Even though css is supported, is preferred to use sass)
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as test runner
* [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) as the test suite
* [Eslint](http://eslint.org/) for linting javascript files
* [Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) for linting styles files

## Setup instructions

1. `yarn install` This will install all the dependencies from **yarn.lock** file.
2. `yarn start` This will fire up webpack and a little server on port 8080 using **webpack-dev-server**
3. `yarn build` This will create a production bundle (under construction)

## Useful scripts
1. `yarn test` This will lint your files and then run unit testing on the project
2. `yarn test:unit` This runs only unit testing for the project
3. `yarn lint` This will check for linting errors on `js | jsx` files
4. `yarn lint:styles` This will lint only style files

## Todo
* Improve construction build
