# Mahisoft mentorship project

## Goal

The main goal of this workshop is to create a base project for modern web applications, and learn cool and cutting edge technologies in the process.

## Technologies

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) as a dependency manager
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as a module bundler
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as the web library
* [Javascript ES6](http://es6-features.org/) as the programming language
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as test runner
* [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) as the test suite

## Setup instructions

1. `yarn install` This will install all the dependencies from **yarn.lock** file.
2. `yarn start` This will fire up webpack and a little server on port 8080 using **webpack-dev-server**
